# Pedestrian Simulator (Pedsim_ROS) - Distracted Node

This repository presents the library "Pedestrian Simulator (Pedsim_ROS) - Distracted Node" for a pedestrians simulator with distracted behavior based on the [Pedsim_ROS](https://github.com/srl-freiburg/pedsim_ros) library which is also based on social force
model of [Helbing et. al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9805244.pdf) and predictive collision avoidance model of [Karamouzas et. al](https://cdef6307-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/ikaramouzas/publications/mig09.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cobMHWBC3L8HB6gys3lZfBxUE1bzaeCH2h28V6j8zvQaPjr6igedCMRpoHdX2aOkeBJm3pg0nSxgUi2jKVvy_K1zMND_3UyMvSx1bpTiNc30u8B6020Qw43mvMKJaD1vG30AvTykZH3MgT9T1hMecr5STZmGw5tQ4ziNP7PRth2_HMZKDOnyaFYCHg7U1mbUVGO7cUEnZ2gqvnACd5fghO0NSm1RqocaEnju4X7XsOKuPqmSEk%3D&attredirects=0). The implementation of the library is based on the addition of nodes and distractor topics to show different behaviors of the agents.
